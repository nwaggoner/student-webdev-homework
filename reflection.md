## Reflection Document

### HTML

I was mostly able to complete these tasks on my own. I think the exercises were simple and/or pretty easy but that served as a good warm up to the remainder of the class. I think overall, these excercises were straight-forward.

### Accessibility

I was able to complete these excercises on my own pretty easily. I felt the excercises were (like HTML) pretty straight forward. I would have liked an explanation on how to use lighthouse with sites being previewed through the IDE with live server.

### CSS

I used the sides extensively for these excercises to ensure I had the right selectors and specificity. Overall, these excercises were fun and engaging. I don't think they needed much else as the amount of work felt perfect and I learned a lot about selectors.
